# The wire protocol, v4

[Back to the README](../README.md)

One WebSocket. Text frames are JSON control messages, binary frames are chunk
bodies. Everything except sizes and timestamps is encrypted by the client
before it is sent.

Basalt does not speak Obsidian Sync's protocol. That protocol has seven defects
we hit in practice, six of which fail silently, and each design rule below
inverts one.

## Design rules

1. **Name the outcome.** In Obsidian's protocol `{res:"ok"}` on a push means
   *discard the upload*, so the most natural success reply is the destructive
   one. Basalt uses verbs: `have`, `want`, `ack`, `err`.

2. **Never require a device to recognise its own echo.** Obsidian's pusher
   receives its own change back and must match it on five fields or it
   downloads its own file over itself. Basalt acks with the assigned uid, and a
   device's own write comes back as an empty batch.

3. **Ordering is a property of a message, not of the stream.** Batches carry
   `from` and `to`, so a gap is detectable. Obsidian makes the server solely
   responsible for wire ordering and a gap invisible.

4. **No persisted boolean decides whether a vault uploads.** The client says
   what it holds, the server says what it holds. Obsidian's `initial` flag,
   stored per sync record, once reported "Fully synced" over an empty vault.

5. **Validate on the way in.** A name the client cannot later write is rejected
   at `put` with a reason. Obsidian validates on download only, so a file with
   `:` in its name uploads and can never come back down. Paths are encrypted,
   so the client checks the name and the server checks structure and bounds.

6. **Namespace by string, version the protocol.** The crypto scheme is
   `basalt/hkdf-aes-gcm/1`, not an integer shared with other implementations.
   A version mismatch is refused, not negotiated.

## Handshake

A hello offers one of three credentials, and which one decides what the session
may do.

**A device connecting.** `deviceId` names its row in the vault's device list
and `token` is that device's own auth key.

```
-> {op:"hello", id, proto:4, vault, deviceId, token, device,
    crypto:"basalt/hkdf-aes-gcm/1", cursor}
<- {res:"ready", id, proto:4, minProto:4, serverVersion, cursor,
    perFileMax, chunkMax, maxChunks, maxBatchBytes, maxFetchBytes, wrapped}
```

**The vault's own credential.** No `deviceId`, and `token` is the key derived
from the root secret, which is the recovery key. What comes back is a
registrar session: it may `register` a device, `rotate` the vault's secret, and
administer the device list with `devices`, `revoke` and `uninvite`. It may not
read or write a note, and has nothing else to send.

```
-> {op:"hello", id, proto:4, vault, token, device, crypto, claim?, wrapped?}
<- {res:"registrar", id, proto:4, minProto:4, serverVersion, maxDevices}
```

A registrar gets no `ready`, no catch-up and no place in the fan-out, because
there is nothing it may be sent. `ready` promises the ceilings for a `put` and
a backlog behind it, and promising a catch-up nobody would send is how a client
comes to wait for a frame that never arrives.

**An invite being redeemed.** `invite` in place of a token, beside the device
row the redemption is to register. It is answered `redeemed` and closed; see
**Adding a device with a single-use invite**, the ordinary way a device is
added and the reason the recovery key stays offline.

```
-> {op:"hello", id, proto:4, vault, device, crypto, invite, deviceId, auth, name?}
<- {res:"redeemed", id, sealed, deviceId}
```

`cursor` is the last uid the client applied, or 0. The server speaks every
version from `minProto` to `proto` and answers in the one the client asked for,
so the upgrade order is the server first, then each client. That range is one
version wide: 4 is the only protocol, and anything outside it, or a `crypto`
the server does not implement, is refused with `{res:"err", code:"proto"}`
naming both numbers rather than negotiated. Interoperating with a version we
have not seen is how a silent incompatibility ships. That refusal does not name
the server's version: nothing has authenticated when it is sent, and
`serverVersion` travels in `ready` and `registrar`, after a hello has
succeeded.

`claim` and `wrapped` travel together, and a hello carrying a claim without a
valid `wrapped` is refused with `badentry` and ends, whatever state the vault
is in. Every claimed vault therefore has a data key and every `ready` carries
one.

A client sends the pair only while it is still claiming, which is while it
holds the server's first-run token, and sends the same `wrapped` every time: a
claim retried after a lost reply must offer the key it offered before, or the
vault can be bound to one candidate while the device goes on proposing another.
A claim on a claimed vault changes nothing on the server, but hands a wrapping
of a data key to a server with no honest use for it, and a dishonest one can
return that wrapping as the vault's own; see **The data key**.

`vault` and `device` are at most 64 characters and contain no control
characters; either fault is `badname` and ends the session, because both land
in logs and file paths. `deviceId` is at most 64 characters of base64url, with
no minimum: the server cannot check that sixteen random bytes were random, and
a minimum would admit a string of A's anyway. A malformed one is `badname` too,
not `auth`, because it is a fact about the request, and answering with `auth`
would make the shape of an id look like the answer to whether that device is
registered. A hello carrying a `deviceId` and also a `claim` is `badentry`: one
is a registered device connecting, the other is how a vault is bound. A
`deviceId` beside an `invite` is not that case and is required: see below.

`ready` carries every ceiling the server enforces, before any catch-up, so a
client knows them all before its first `put`: the largest file, chunk and chunk
list, the largest encoded `putmany` frame (`maxBatchBytes`) and the most body
bytes one `fetch` may ask for (`maxFetchBytes`). A request over a ceiling is
refused with `toolarge`, never a bare disconnect, and every legal message fits
under the server's read limit. `ready.cursor` is what the server holds. `wrapped` is the vault's wrapped data key when it has one; see
**Authentication**.

## Request ids

Every request that expects a reply carries `id`, a client-chosen integer from 1
to 2^32-1, unique among the requests in flight: `hello`, `put`, `putmany`,
`get`, `fetch`, `history`, `deleted`, `invite`, `uninvite`, `rotate`,
`register`, `devices`, `revoke`. The reply echoes it, and so does an `err`
refusing that request. A request with no `id`, or one outside that range, is
`protostate` and ends the session. `batch`, `caught-up` and pings are
unsolicited and carry no `id`. The server never sends an `id` it was not given.
A client ends the session on a reply whose `id` it does not recognise, and
treats an `err` with no `id` as the reason the connection is about to close.

Before ids, a reply was matched to the one request in flight by position, and
three separate defects came from that: a fast acknowledgement arriving before
its waiter was armed, a shutdown notice mistaken for a bad reply, and bodies
from a refused fetch consumed by the next one.

A client whose cursor is **ahead** of the server's is refused with
`code:"cursor"`. The server has lost history the client already applied, from
an old backup or the wrong vault. Continuing would reissue those uids for
different content and the two would diverge with both reporting success.

## Catch-up

```
<- {res:"ready", ...}
<- {op:"batch", from:120, to:139, entries:[...]}
<- {op:"batch", from:140, to:151, entries:[...]}
<- {op:"caught-up", cursor:151}
```

`batch` is the only message that carries entries. A live change is a batch of
one, so catch-up and live delivery share one code path.

`from` and `to` are a covered range: every entry with `from <= uid <= to` is in
the batch. Purge leaves holes in the uid sequence, and this reading means a
hole is not a lost file. The continuity check is `from == cursor + 1`.

Batches leave the server in uid order, always, including under concurrent
pushes. A device's own committed write arrives as a batch with `entries: []`,
so the cursor advances and there is nothing to mistake for a remote file. Live
changes that arrive mid-catch-up are held and released in order afterwards.

## Writing a file

```
-> {op:"put", id, path, meta:{size, ctime, mtime, folder, deleted, prev?},
    chunks:[h1,h2,h3], mac, parent}
<- {res:"want", id, chunks:[h2]}      only what the server lacks
-> binary frame for h2
<- {res:"ack", id, uid:152}
```

- Chunking is content-defined on a rolling hash, so inserting a line near the
  start of a large note changes one chunk instead of shifting all of them.
- `chunks` are lowercase hex SHA-256 hashes of the **encrypted** chunks, exactly
  64 characters. The server recomputes the hash on the way in and on the way
  out, so a body that does not match its name is refused, and bit rot surfaces
  as an error naming the chunk. Uploaded bodies are matched to `want` by
  hashing them, not by position.
- The stored ciphertext for one entry may not exceed `size + 256 * len(chunks)`
  bytes, counting repeated chunks once per reference. Over that is `toolarge`.
  Enforced as bodies arrive and again at commit.
- A file has chunks if and only if it has content. Zero-byte notes, folders and
  deletions carry none. `chunks` is always an array, in every direction.
- `{res:"have", uid}` means the server already held every chunk and the entry is
  recorded. `have` and `ack` are different outcomes and both are named.
- The ack is withheld until every chunk and the entry are durable.
- `prev` is the previous path on a rename, so a rename is one operation.
- `mac` and `parent` authenticate the entry; see below. The server holds no key
  and checks neither, but refuses an entry with no `mac` of the right shape.
- A rejected `put` returns `{res:"err", code, msg}` and the session continues.
- A quiet connection is kept. The server pings an idle session and expects a
  pong, but not while frames are queued or a request is in flight, because a
  client busy reading a large fetch cannot answer. A client that stops
  answering is closed within a ping interval.
- On shutdown the server sends every idle session `{res:"err", code:"busy"}`
  with a reason and closes it; a request in flight is allowed to finish first.
  A client treats an error it did not ask for as the close reason.
- A reply can arrive before the one you asked for, because another device can
  commit at any moment. Clients demultiplex on `op` before matching a `res`.

## Writing many files at once

```
-> {op:"putmany", id, entries:[{path, meta, chunks, mac, parent}, ...]}
<- {res:"want", id, chunks:[h1,h2,h3]}    the union of what the server lacks
-> binary frames, in that order
<- {res:"acks", id, results:[{uid:152}, {uid:153}, {code, msg}, ...]}
```

Up to 256 entries, at most `maxBatchBytes` of encoded request, and at most
`maxBatchBytes` of summed ciphertext budget (`size + 256 * len(chunks)` over
every entry); a client splits a batch that would exceed any of the three, and
sends a file whose own budget exceeds it with `put`. `results` has one slot per
entry, in the order sent. A refused entry appears as `{code, msg}` in its slot
and does not refuse the batch, so a client never has to bisect two hundred
notes to find the one the server would not take. An empty batch is `badentry`; over 256 is `toolarge`.
Every rule of `put` applies.

## Authenticating an entry

The `mac` is an HMAC under a key derived for this alone, over a canonical
encoding of the sealed path, the size and times, the flags, `prev`, the chunk
list in order, and `parent`. Fields are length-prefixed rather than delimited,
because a delimiter is a character somebody's filename eventually contains.

The uid is not covered. The server assigns uids and ordering the log is its
job.

`parent` is a digest of the content id of the version the writer built on, or
empty for a file it had never synced. It is per path rather than global, which
keeps concurrent writers from serialising, and the cost of that is that a
server withholding a version is undetectable.

It is what would tell a new version from an old one replayed, and no client
checks it yet. Until one does, a server can hand back a version a device
really wrote under a newer uid and the receiving device applies it, which
reverts the note. The field is signed and carried so that the check can be
added without a protocol change; docs/design.md, under what the server can do,
says what is bounded and what a fresh device still cannot see.

## Reading a file

```
-> {op:"get", id, uid}
<- {res:"chunks", id, uid, size, chunks:[h1,h2,h3]}
-> {op:"fetch", id, chunks:[h2]}      only what this device lacks
<- {res:"bodies", id, count:1}
<- binary frame for h2
```

One `fetch` may name the chunks of many files, up to `maxFetchBytes` of them,
so a first download is a handful of round trips rather than one per file. The
answer is either `bodies`, announcing exactly how many binary frames follow in
the order asked, or an `err`, and never bodies followed by an error. A `fetch`
naming any chunk the server lacks is `nochunk` with no bodies, because failing
halfway leaves a client unable to tell which frames it received.

A `get` for a missing uid is `nouid`. One for a folder or a deletion is
`nocontent`, distinct from an empty chunk list, which is a real zero-byte note.

## Deleting

A deletion is an entry with `deleted: true`, not the absence of one. The record
is what makes the file recoverable.

## Repairing a body the server has lost

A chunk can go missing while every row stays exactly as it was: a disk rots one
and the server quarantines it, or a restore brings back a database and a chunk
tree of slightly different ages. Every device that wants that version then
downloads it for ever, which looks like a sync that never finishes rather than
an error anybody can act on.

Nothing in ordinary reconciliation fixes it, and that is the point of a separate
op. A device whose copy of the note has not changed is right to consider it
synced: the entry is committed, the hashes agree, and a pass has nothing to do.
It is holding the missing bytes and has no reason to send them. The only way to
make it send them used to be to edit the note, which writes a version nobody
typed into the history of a vault that is already damaged.

So `resend` is a put with no entry:

```
-> {"op":"resend","id":9,"chunks":["<name>", ...]}
<- {"res":"want","id":9,"chunks":["<name>"]}       the ones it actually lacks
-> <binary frame per wanted chunk, in order>
<- {"res":"resent","id":9,"stored":1,"missing":0}
```

No uid is allocated, no entry is written, no authenticator is touched. A vault
repaired this way is the vault it should have been.

Two rules make it safe to let a device write bodies with no entry behind them:

- a body is content-addressed, so the server hashes what arrives and refuses
  anything that is not the body its name claims. A device cannot put the wrong
  bytes under a name however much it would like to.
- a name no committed entry in the vault refers to is refused outright, with
  `nochunk`. Correct bytes under an unreferenced name are still a paired device
  writing into the store for ever, and repair is for bodies the vault is
  missing.

`missing` in the reply counts bodies the server asked for, was sent, and still
does not have, which is a full disk rather than a normal outcome. What the reply
cannot say is how much of the vault's *history* is gone, because the client
never named those chunks: a device can only offer what it holds. `basaltd
verify` on the server is what knows, and `basalt repair` says so.

## Recovery

Two read-only operations:

| | |
|---|---|
| `{op:"history", id, path, before?, limit?}` | `{res:"history", id, path, entries}` |
| `{op:"deleted", id, limit?}` | `{res:"deleted", id, entries, more}` |

`path` is sealed in both directions. `history` returns every version of one
path newest first, deletions included; `before` pages backwards. An empty list
is indistinguishable from a purged history, because the server cannot tell them
apart. `deleted` returns paths whose newest version is a deletion, renames
suppressed, bounded at 1000, with `more` set when cut short. Each entry
carries `restorable`, the uid of the newest version with content, or 0 after a
purge.

There is no `restore` operation. A client fetches the version with `get`,
writes it, and the ordinary sync uploads it as a new version. The server keeps
one way to change a vault.

## Authentication

Two credentials, deliberately separated. The separation is the point.

| credential | held by | may |
|---|---|---|
| the vault's auth key, derived from the root secret | nobody, offline, written down as the recovery key | register a device, rotate the vault's secret, administer the device list |
| a device's auth key | one device | connect and sync as that device, read the device list, issue and cancel invites, and revoke any device but the last |

The server stores only `sha256` of either key, unsalted. That is right for a
random 256-bit key, where there is nothing to guess and nothing for a slow hash
to slow down, and it must never be reused for anything a person chose. A stolen
disk yields ciphertext without the ability to add to it.

**The vault's credential may not sync.** It registers a device and nothing
else. A credential every device holds cannot be revoked from any one of them,
and a device list with no revocation is worse than no list, because it looks
like it works.

One code path builds a syncing session, and the only way into it is a
`deviceId` whose stored hash matched the offered key. A registrar session is
refused every op that reads or writes a note, is in no fan-out, and is not
counted against the vault's connected-device limit, because it is not a device.

A registrar may also read the device list and take a row off it. The list is
who may connect rather than what the vault holds and carries no key material,
and two things need the recovery key to reach it: emptying the vault is the
recovery key's alone, below, and a vault whose every row is a crashed pairing
refuses each new registration with `full`, leaving no device to prune the list
from. The cost: a leaked root can stop devices connecting, where before it
could only read and add. Rotation answers that, and every write a registrar
makes, `revoke` included, is conditional on the credential it authenticated
under still being the vault's.

**Claiming.** A vault with no auth hash is opened only by the server's
first-run token, in exchange for `claim`, the key it is to be bound to, and
`wrapped`. Claiming is one-time and cannot be undone over the wire, or a second
device could lock the first out. A device sends `claim` while it still holds
the bootstrap token and not after, so it never has to work out whether it is
first. A hello that claims is a registrar session like any other, so creating a
vault is: claim, `register` the first device, then connect as that device. A
session that authenticated with the bootstrap token may not `rotate`: it proved
nothing about holding the old root.

### The device list

A device is a row: an id it chose, a name a person reads, the hash of its own
auth key, when it was created and when it was last seen. The id is the
identity; the name never is, and two laptops may both be called laptop.

```
-> {op:"register", id, deviceId, auth, name?}     registrar sessions only
<- {res:"registered", id, deviceId, wrapped}

-> {op:"devices", id}                             either credential
<- {res:"devices", id, devices, maxDevices, invites}

-> {op:"revoke", id, deviceId, allowLast?}        either credential
<- {res:"revoked", id, deviceId, self}            allowLast: registrar only
```

`auth` is the new device's auth key, not its hash, for the same reason `claim`
is the key: the server keeps only the digest either way, so the key reveals
nothing the digest would have hidden, and it buys the ability to refuse a
credential short enough to guess. `name` defaults to the session's own
`device`. `wrapped` comes back because the registering session holds the root
and can unwrap it, which is how a device ends up holding the data key without
ever holding the root.

Registering the same `deviceId` with the same key again succeeds and is the
registration having happened: the half-finished case where the row committed
and the reply was lost. Answering `badentry` there would leave a device
retrying for ever, the same defect a duplicate invite identifier had. A *different* key under an id the vault already holds is
somebody else's device and is `badentry`, and nothing is overwritten.

**A device may not `register`.** It holds no vault credential, so a stolen
laptop cannot mint a row directly, cannot `rotate`, and cannot produce the
recovery key. It **can** still add a device by issuing an invite, and that is
the design rather than a hole: the recovery key stays offline, so something a
device holds has to admit the next one. The honest boundary is that it cannot
do so unseen, because both the row and the outstanding invite are in the same
`devices` listing. A device may send `devices`, `invite`, `uninvite`, and
`revoke` for any device but the vault's last, itself included, which is what
unlinking is.

**Revoking closes the device's live sessions**, and the reply means both. The
row alone would be a revocation the revoked device never notices: nothing on a
live session is re-checked, so it would go on receiving every note pushed to
the vault while the panel said it was gone. The order is the guarantee. A
revoke deletes the row and only then
collects the sessions to close; a connecting device joins the fan-out and only
then stamps its `lastSeen`. So either the delete is first, the stamp finds no
row and the connect is refused, or the join is first and the revoke finds the
session. No interleaving leaves a revoked device connected.

**Emptying the vault takes the recovery key.** Ordinary revocation is any
device's: a phone cutting off a stolen laptop without anybody digging out the
recovery key is why there is revocation here rather than only rotation. The
last row is the exception, and the only one. `allowLast` is honoured on a
registrar session and refused with `auth` on a device's, because what it leaves
is a vault only the recovery key opens, and a compromised device could
otherwise delete every row and leave its owner holding devices that cannot
reach their own notes. It costs nothing in the case it is for, since a device
stolen when it was the only one wants a rotation as well, and rotating already
needs the key. A registrar still has to send `allowLast`, and without it gets
`badentry`. Revoking an id the vault does not have is `nodevice`: the list you
were reading is stale.

Revoking stops a device connecting. It does not un-read what that device
already read: it still holds the data key and can decrypt every note it had
synced. A device that was stolen rather than merely lost wants a rotation too.

**Eight devices.** `maxDevices` is in `registrar` and in the device list, so a
client knows the cap before it registers rather than by being refused. The
ninth registration is `full`, not `busy`: `busy` means come back later, and
this never becomes true by waiting, because somebody has to revoke a device.

`full` names how many of the vault's rows have never connected, and both
clients flag those rows. They are the reclaimable ones, and what the redemption
ordering costs: the row is written before the device redeeming it saves
anything, so a pairing that reaches the server and then crashes strands a row
rather than a device that believes it is paired. Eight of them, or eight an
attacker minted invites for, fill the cap. Nothing reclaims one on its own,
because a server deleting a row that looks unused is the failure the cap
decision already refused; naming them is what makes "the vault is full" an
instruction.

It is the same eight as the connected-device limit, pinned by a test, since a
vault that could register more devices than it can connect would have one that
registers and is then refused with `busy` for ever with nothing saying why. A
vault that somehow holds more keeps every row and all of those devices go on
syncing: the cap bounds growth, and enforcing it backwards would mean the
server silently choosing which of somebody's devices stops working.

### The data key, and rotating a leaked secret

Every claimed vault has a **data key**: 32 random bytes generated by the first
device, wrapped under a key derived from the root secret, and stored on the
server as an opaque blob. Every key that touches content derives from the data
key; only the vault's auth key and the wrapping key derive from the root. The
server returns the blob in `ready` and hands it to a registrar in `registered`,
and cannot open it: it holds neither key.

That indirection separates the two credentials. A device is given the data key
when it is registered, by the registrar that could unwrap it, so a device never
needs the root and never holds it. It is also what makes a leaked recovery key
survivable, below.

Rotating is a registrar's op, because it is the root that is being replaced:

```
-> {op:"rotate", id, auth, wrapped}       registrar sessions only
<- {res:"rotated", id}
```

`auth` is the new auth key and `wrapped` the same data key wrapped under the
new root. The server replaces the stored hash and blob in one transaction, and
from then on only the new root opens the vault. History is untouched, because
nothing sealed under the data key changed.

**A rotation touches no device row, and every device keeps syncing across
one**, mid-session, without pairing again. Device credentials are independent
of the root, so replacing the root rewraps the data key and evicts nobody. A
rotation that evicted every device would be a weekend of pairing, which is how
a leaked string goes unrotated.

What a rotation does close is every *other* registrar session on the vault,
with an unsolicited `{res:"err", code:"auth"}`. Those are holding the root that
was just retired.

Every write a registrar makes is conditional on the credential its session
authenticated under still being the vault's, so a retired root can make none of
them. A second `rotate` is refused with `rotated`, and so are a `register` and
a `revoke`. Closing a socket does not stop a request already in flight, so an
unconditional swap let the loser overwrite the winner and the device the winner
was revoking ended up owning the vault.

The two device-list ops are the same race with worse prizes, and both turn on
the fact that a rotation deliberately leaves every device row alone. A device
registered a millisecond too late by the leaked key would still be there
afterwards: permanent access outliving the rotation meant to end it. A row
deleted a millisecond too late is the other direction, the retired root
answering the rotation by locking every real device out of the vault.

A client that has a rotation outstanding, sent with no reply, keeps both
secrets and tries the new one first on its next connect, falling back to the
old one. The server commits before it answers, so a lost reply is otherwise a
vault whose new root exists only in the process that made it.

Every vault has a data key, so rotation always works in place and never costs
the history.

### Adding a device with a single-use invite

The root secret is shown once, to the person who starts the vault, as a
recovery key to write down. It is never shown again, and adding a device does
not need it: a device that already has the vault issues an invite instead.

```
-> {op:"invite", id, invite, sealed, ttlMs?}      device sessions only
<- {res:"invited", id, expiresAt}
```

`invite` is a random 128-bit identifier and `sealed` is the **vault's data
key** sealed under a random 256-bit invite key, `n || AES-GCM-256(K_inv, n,
K_data)`, both base64url. The server stores the identifier, the blob and an
expiry, and returns nothing but the expiry. `ttlMs` defaults to ten minutes and
may not exceed one hour. The issuing device hands the person an invite string:
`basalt3i_` followed by base64url of a version byte, the identifier, the invite
key, the length-prefixed server address and vault id, and a CRC-32. The invite
key never reaches the server, so a stolen disk holds blobs it cannot open, and
the identifier is unguessable, so a stranger cannot redeem one by trying.

The data key and not the root, since protocol 4. A device holds no root, so it
has none to seal, and an invite that carried one would hand the new device the
credential that registers devices and rewraps the vault: everything revoking a
device is meant to take back.

An invite that has not been redeemed is visible, and can be cancelled:

```
-> {op:"uninvite", id, invite}                    either credential
<- {res:"uninvited", id, invite}
```

Outstanding invites ride on the device list, in `invites`, as an identifier and
an expiry each and never the sealed blob. Before that, an invite was the one
authority on a vault nothing could see: a string issued on a stolen laptop
stayed invisible until somebody redeemed it, for up to an hour. Seeing the
identifier redeems nothing, since that also takes the invite key, which only
the person holding the string has. The identifier is for `uninvite`, which
deletes the row so the string stops working before it expires; the only
alternatives were to wait out the hour or to rotate, which retires the recovery
key with it. An identifier that is unknown, expired or already redeemed is one
`badentry`, saying which of the three to nobody, and the message says to look
at the device list, because a redeemed invite is a row there now.

The new device redeems it at hello, in place of a token, and names the device
row it is asking for:

```
-> {op:"hello", id, proto:4, vault, device, crypto, invite, deviceId, auth, name?}
<- {res:"redeemed", id, sealed, deviceId}
```

**Redeeming registers the device.** The invite is unguessable, single use,
server tracked and expiring, which is exactly the authority to register one
device, and it has to be: the issuing device holds no root and cannot register
a row on the newcomer's behalf, and the newcomer holds nothing else the server
would accept a registration under. `deviceId` and `auth` are the row's id and
the key its hash is taken from, the same fields `register` takes and bounded
the same way; `name` defaults to `device`.

The spend and the insert are one transaction. An invite is never spent without
a row, and no row is ever written under an invite that is still live, so every
refusal below leaves the string in somebody's hand still working.

The session closes after `redeemed`. It is not a device session: nothing on it
has proved that anybody holds the key just registered, and the redeemer has to
write that key and the data key down before using either. Its next hello, as an
ordinary device, is the proof. There is no `wrapped` in the reply and there
must not be: the wrapping opens under the root and a redeemer holds none.

Refusals. An unknown, expired, already used or malformed invite is `auth`,
never saying which, and so is an unclaimed vault. A hello carrying an invite
without a `deviceId`, with an `auth` key shorter than 32 characters, or with a
name the server will not store, is `badname` or `badentry`: facts about the
frame, not the vault, so naming them cannot leak whether the invite exists. An
id the vault already holds is `badentry`, and the invite stays unspent so the
redeemer can pick another. A vault at its device cap is `full`, not `busy`,
since waiting never makes room, and the refusal names the rows that have never
connected. Both a token and an invite, or a claim and an invite, is `badentry`:
an invite stands in for the one and excludes the other. Issuing an invite under
an identifier the vault already holds is `badentry` too, rather than a
retryable `internal` a client would repeat for ever.

`rotate` deletes every outstanding invite on the vault, the same guard
registration has: a rotation exists to end access somebody should not have, and
an invite issued before one is a device somebody could still add after it.
`invite` is refused with `auth` on a registrar session, which is what a session
holding the vault credential or the bootstrap token gets: an invite seals the
data key, which a registrar does not hold. `uninvite` is not, because
cancelling one needs nothing but the identifier.

The recovery key is still a pairing string (`basalt3_`) and `pair` still
accepts one, because a vault whose every device is lost has nothing else: it is
the credential that opens a registrar session, registers a device and hands it
the data key. That is the last resort, not the ordinary path, and both shells
say so where they offer it.

## Which clients may connect

The server verifies the `Origin` header. A Go or Node client sends none and is
allowed. Browser clients, which include Obsidian, must match `app://obsidian.md`,
`capacitor://localhost` or `http://localhost`, or a `-allow-origin` value. A
refused handshake logs the origin and the flag that would admit it.

## Crypto

`basalt/hkdf-aes-gcm/1` names the sealing construction. It is versioned
separately from the wire, because how a chunk is sealed and how two ends talk
change for different reasons.

```
S                                       root secret, 256 bits, in a basalt3_ recovery key
K_auth    = HKDF(S, "basalt/auth/1")    the server stores only H(K_auth)
K_wrap    = HKDF(S, "basalt/wrap/1")
D         = 32 random bytes             the data key, generated once by the first device
wrapped   = n || AES-GCM-256(K_wrap, n, D)   n a random 12-byte nonce; stored by the server

K_path    = HKDF(D, "basalt/path/1")
K_content = HKDF(D, "basalt/content/1")
K_nonce   = HKDF(D, "basalt/nonce/1")
K_meta    = HKDF(D, "basalt/meta/1")

nonce(p)  = HMAC-SHA-256(K_nonce, p)[:12]
seal(K,p) = nonce(p) || AES-GCM-256(K, nonce(p), p)
```

There is one schedule and every content key hangs off `D`. That is the reason a
leaked `S` can be retired: nothing sealed depends on it. It also removes a
state a server could otherwise choose: when a vault might or might not have had
a data key, a server could pick the schedule a device used by leaving `wrapped`
out of `ready`, and the device had no way to know.

Paths and chunks use the same construction under different keys. The nonce is
derived from the plaintext, so sealing is deterministic. Equal paths must seal
equal or the server cannot group versions of a file. Equal chunks must seal
equal or dedup does nothing, since chunk names are hashes of ciphertext. A
nonce repeats only for identical plaintext under the same key, which is exactly
the equality being asked for.

A chunk body is compressed before sealing. The sealed plaintext is one marker
byte, `0` for stored as-is or `1` for raw deflate at level 6, then the payload.
A chunk that does not shrink is stored as-is, so a sealed chunk is never more
than 29 bytes larger than its content. The marker is inside the sealed bytes,
so the server cannot tell which chunks compressed. The deflate implementation
must be deterministic across platforms, or the same chunk gets different names
on a desktop and a phone and dedup silently stops.

It is spelled out from HMAC and AES-GCM rather than named AES-GCM-SIV because
WebCrypto has no SIV mode, and the client runs in a webview on at least one
platform.

## What the server can see

Sizes, timestamps, chunk counts, the number of files, which sealed path changed
when, and which chunks are byte-identical. Not contents, not names, not folder
structure.

## Errors

```
<- {res:"err", id?, code, msg, retryable, retryAfterMs?}
```

`code` is for the client, `msg` is for the human. Every rejection has both.
`id` is present when the error answers a request. `retryable` says whether
reconnecting later can succeed where retrying the same request cannot: a
watching client backs off and reconnects on a retryable error and stops on any
other, with nothing to interpret. `retryAfterMs` is a hint on `busy`, so a
device refused for the device limit does not hot-loop. The two causes carry
different hints: 30 seconds at the device limit, where a slot frees when
somebody closes a laptop, and 5 seconds on shutdown, where the server is
expected straight back.

Every error carries `retryable`, including the ones sent before a hello has
been read. A client still keeps a default by code for a frame that arrives
without the field, a defence against a malformed answer rather than a second
shape to support: a refusal at admission during shutdown or at the pre-auth
cap, a first frame that is not a hello, or an unsupported `proto`. What such an
error lacks is an `id`, because it answers no request, and so do the shutdown
and rotation notices.

The session **continues** after a code that rejects one request, and **ends**
after one that means the connection should not have been opened or the two ends
no longer agree how many frames are outstanding.

| code | meaning | retryable | session |
|---|---|---|---|
| `proto` | unsupported `proto` or `crypto`, or a vault an older build claimed with no data key | no | ends; it is only sent at hello |
| `auth` | bad token, vault or device, never saying which; or an op, or a field of one, this session's credential may not send | no | ends at hello, continues when it refuses one op |
| `cursor` | the client is ahead of the server | no | ends |
| `rotated` | a `rotate`, `register` or `revoke` whose credential is no longer the vault's, because somebody rotated first | no | ends |
| `busy` | the vault's device limit, or the server is shutting down | yes, with `retryAfterMs` | ends |
| `protostate` | a message that does not belong in the current state | no | ends, except an unknown op or a negative `before` on a `history`, which reject that one request and continue |
| `badchunk` | a body that does not hash to the name asked for, or a malformed chunk name | no | continues, except a bad body arriving mid-upload, which ends because the two ends no longer agree how many frames remain |
| `badentry` | a structurally invalid put, or a well-formed request the vault's state refuses: a duplicate device id, or the last device without `allowLast`. A device sending `allowLast` is `auth` instead, because that is about its credential | no | continues, except a claim at hello carrying no valid `wrapped`, which ends |
| `badname` | a path the server cannot store, or a malformed device id | no | continues, except an over-long device name or a malformed device id at hello, which end |
| `toolarge` | above an advertised ceiling, or more ciphertext than the size allows | no | continues, except uploads passing the declared size mid-put, which ends |
| `nospace` | refused for want of disk | yes | ends; it can only arise mid-upload, where the frame count is no longer agreed |
| `nouid` | no such entry | no | continues |
| `nocontent` | the entry is a folder or a deletion | no | continues |
| `nochunk` | the server does not hold that chunk | no | continues; a body that fails its own hash is found before the header, quarantined, and refused with no bodies sent |
| `nodevice` | this vault has no device with that id; the list you read is stale | no | continues |
| `full` | the vault already has as many devices as it may register | no | continues |
| `internal` | a server-side fault; the put is not committed | yes | ends during handshake or catch-up, otherwise continues |

### Why `busy` is still not two codes

`busy` covers the vault's connected-device limit and a server shutting down,
and splitting them has been proposed more than once. Protocol 4 did add a
`full`, deliberately not this: `full` is the *registration* cap, which no
waiting clears. A connection refused at the device limit succeeds when somebody
closes a laptop; a ninth registration succeeds when somebody revokes a device.

The reason the connection limit keeps sharing `busy` is in the client: a client
decides whether to retry from an allowlist of codes it knows, so a code it has
never seen is not retryable. Send a device at the connection limit a code it
does not know and it stops for good, where `busy` has it come back.

Nothing is lost by the sharing. Both conditions want the same thing from a
client, come back later, and they already differ in `retryAfterMs` and in the
message: `this server is shutting down, reconnect in a moment` or
`vault has 8 devices connected, limit is 8`.

If it is ever split, both ends move together: the client learns the new code
first and only then may a server send it.
