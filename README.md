**Fast, private, self-hosted sync for Obsidian.**

One binary and one pairing string. Only the part of a note that changed crosses the wire, and it is encrypted before it leaves your device.

## Why

I wanted self-hosted sync that is as easy as the official one, without the setup every other sync plugin asks for. So: one server, one panel, and no settings to get wrong.

## Get started

**1. Run the server.**

```bash
docker run -d --name basalt -p 127.0.0.1:3003:3003 -v basalt-data:/data ghcr.io/waynehoover/basalt-sync
docker logs basalt
```

The log prints one line for your first device: `host:3003#TOKEN`. There is no TLS in the binary on purpose, so put something in front before anything else reaches it. `tailscale serve --bg 3003` does it; [docs/server.md](docs/server.md) has Compose, systemd and Caddy.

**2. Install the plugin.** Not in the community directory yet, so drop `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/waynehoover/basalt-sync/releases/latest) into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/basalt-sync/`, then enable Basalt Sync under Community plugins.

**3. Start the vault.** Open Basalt from the ribbon icon or Settings, paste that line under **Start a new vault**, and write down the recovery key it shows once. It is the only way back if every device is lost, and anyone holding it has the vault.

**4. Add your other devices.** On a device that already has the vault, press **Add another device**, then **Create invite**, and paste what it shows into Basalt on the new one. An invite works once and expires in ten minutes.

### Without Obsidian

The same engine with the filesystem in place of Obsidian's API, for a NAS or a server.

```bash
npm install -g basalt-sync
basalt init 'homelab:3003#K7M2...'   # the first device, from the server log
basalt invite                        # on a device that has the vault
basalt pair basalt3i_...             # on the new device
basalt sync --watch
```

## What you get

- End-to-end encrypted note contents and file names
- Only the chunk that changed crosses the wire
- Conflicts keep both versions, and never rewrite the file you have open
- Full version history and deleted-note recovery, inside Obsidian
- A credential per device, so a lost one is revoked without touching the others
- A headless client for a machine with no Obsidian (experimental)

**Where it is supported.** Obsidian on macOS and Linux desktops and on Android, over a local filesystem, one Basalt writer per vault. Not iOS, which should work and has never been run. Not a vault another sync tool also has (Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Syncthing, LiveSync): keeping your edits works by moving bytes aside and identifying them afterwards, and a second engine moving the same bytes turns every step of that into a guess. Not a network filesystem. [docs/design.md](docs/design.md#where-this-is-supported) has the whole list and the reasons.

The headless client is experimental. It is a mirror for a machine with no Obsidian, not a general-purpose writable client.

Also not yet: a memory measurement on an older phone, the community directory, and syncing themes and snippets.

## Security

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/security-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/security.svg" alt="The recovery key stays offline and does two things: register a device and rewrap the data key. Each paired device holds a device secret of its own, whose auth key proves it may connect, and the vault's data key, which derives the keys for names, bodies, nonces and version signatures. Only ciphertext crosses to the server, which holds sealed bodies and names, one row per device with a hash of its key, and a wrapped data key it cannot open.">
</picture>

- **The server never holds a key.** It sees ciphertext, its length, and which chunks repeat, which is what deduplication is made of.
- **It cannot write, either.** Every version is signed under a key the server has never seen, so it cannot forge one, alter one, or move a file's contents onto another.
- **Lose a device, revoke a device.** Each holds a credential of its own, never the recovery key. Leak that and `basalt rotate` replaces it without losing history or disconnecting anything.

A server can still go quiet, and it can hand back an old version of a note under a new number, which reverts it to something it really did say once. It cannot invent, alter or mix up a version. Two devices disagreeing is how you notice. Stated rather than solved: [the design doc](docs/design.md) has both, and what would close the second.

## Speed

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/wire-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/wire.svg" alt="Editing one line of a 2 MiB note: whole-file sync sends 2.0 MiB, Basalt sends 21.7 KiB, of which 12.7 KiB is the chunk that changed and 9.0 KiB is the entry naming every chunk of the new version.">
</picture>

- **Only the delta.** Notes are cut into content-defined chunks, so editing one line of a 2 MiB note sends 21.7 KiB.
- **Tens of round trips, not thousands.** Two thousand files reach a second device in 18 up and 27 down.
- **Measured, not claimed.** Including a run against a real 3,751-file vault: [docs/compared.md](docs/compared.md).
