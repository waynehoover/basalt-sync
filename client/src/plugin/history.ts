/**
 * Version history for one note.
 *
 * The server has kept every version since the first commit and nothing in the
 * plugin could reach them: recovery started from the deleted list, so a note you
 * still have but want an older copy of was not reachable at all.
 *
 * ## Why it looks like Obsidian Sync's
 *
 * Sync's own history modal was read in the shipped application to find out what
 * shape people already know: a sidebar of versions newest first, a content pane
 * showing the one you picked, a toggle between the text and a diff against what
 * is on disk, a restore action in the pane's title bar, and a button that pages
 * further back. Arrow keys move between versions and Enter selects.
 *
 * The layout classes here are Obsidian's own (`modal-sidebar`,
 * `modal-sidebar-list-item`, `modal-setting-titlebar`). Using the app's
 * stylesheet is how a plugin looks native rather than approximately native, and
 * it is the same reason a web page uses its framework's classes.
 *
 * ## Where it deliberately differs
 *
 * Restoring never overwrites. If the path is occupied the version lands beside
 * it as `Note (restored 42).md` and the notice says where it went. Sync writes
 * over the file. The whole project's position on this is in
 * docs/design.md: a sync you did not ask for should never rewrite the file
 * you have open, and restoring is a sync you asked for pointed at the past.
