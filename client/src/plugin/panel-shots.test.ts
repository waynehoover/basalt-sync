/**
 * The panel walk: run it, check it captured something real, write it down.
 *
 * `panel-shots.ts` explains at length why what CI can have is an outline and
 * not a picture. This is the gate around it, and the gate is deliberately
 * narrow. The artifact itself is not diffed against a golden copy, because the
 * point of it is to be looked at rather than to be another thing to keep in
 * step; what would be intolerable is the artifact quietly becoming empty, or
 * the walk stopping two states short, and nobody finding out until they went
 * looking for a picture that was not there. So: every state was reached, and
 * each one holds the words and the shape it exists to have.
 *
 * The ordering assertion is the one that earns its place twice over. `de4d519`
 * put the device rows above the row that offers them, and its own commit
 * message says a screenshot found it and a test could not. This checks it
 * against the same text a reviewer reads, so the artifact and the gate are
 * looking at the same thing.
 *
 * Writing the files from a test rather than from a script is not laziness. The
 * plugin cannot be imported outside vitest at all: `main.ts` imports `obsidian`,
 * the npm package has no runtime, and `vitest.config.ts` is the only place the
 * alias to `stub.ts` exists. A standalone runner would need a second copy of
 * that alias, and a second copy is a thing that drifts.
