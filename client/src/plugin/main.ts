/**
 * The plugin, which is a shell and nothing else.
 *
 * It assembles the same four objects the headless client assembles, hands them
 * to the same `Client` in core, and spends the rest of its life drawing a status
 * bar. Every sync decision is a layer down, in code that two engines and a real
 * Go server exercise in tests. If a decision ever appears in this file, it is in
 * the wrong file, because this is the one file that cannot be tested.
 *
 * ## There is no settings tab
 *
 * On purpose, and docs/design.md says why: every option multiplies a state
 * space nobody tested. There is one modal, it exists to pair a vault and to say
 * what is happening, and it has no options in it. Pairing is not a setting; it
 * happens once and then never again.
 *
 * ## What is not verified
 *
 * This file, and `vault.ts` beside it. Both need Obsidian running. Every
 * signature used here was read out of `obsidian.d.ts` rather than remembered,
 * which is as close as it gets until it runs in a vault.

 * or `DOCS` for anybody who wants the rest. What could not be cut was compressed

 * ## Two altitudes
 *
 * design.md: a thing that matters only when something specific happens appears
 * in that moment. Syncing, adding a device and recovering a note are what a
 * panel is opened for; devices, the recovery key, replacing the secret and
 * unlinking are rare and three of the four are destructive. So the rare four
 * sit inside one `<details>`, closed until it is wanted. A `<details>` and not
 * a tab, a second modal or a toggle, because it is the only one of the four
 * that needs no code, no state and no styling to work.
 *
 * What never hides: the status lines, and the rejoin row a refused device
 * grows. A device the server has stopped talking to has to say so on open.
