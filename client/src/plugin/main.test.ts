 * a reason it is hard to test, not a reason it is fine untested, and the shell
 * is where a sync client's setup bugs live.
 *
 * So `stub.ts` supplies the runtime, `vitest.config.ts` aliases the module to it
 * for tests only, and everything below is the real plugin: real pairing, real
 * engine, real WebSocket, real Go server. `tsc` still checks `main.ts` against
 * the genuine declarations, and the shipped bundle still gets Obsidian's own
 * implementation.
 *
 * What this cannot tell you is whether Obsidian calls `onload` when this expects
 * or draws what this builds. That needs Obsidian.
