/**
 * The journal's crash semantics.
 *
 * These are the ten properties docs/index-journal.md pins, and they live at the
 * codec because that is where a crash can be arranged exactly rather than
 * provoked. Every one of them describes something a real filesystem does to a
 * file that was being appended to when the power went: a cut line, a line whose
 * bytes changed under a good newline, NUL padding where the file grew but the
 * write never landed.
 *
 * The property they all serve: an older index is safe, an empty one is not,
 * and an invented one is worst of all.
