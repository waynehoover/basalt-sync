 *    nobody holds the credential for. It shows in `basalt devices` as a device
 *    that has never connected and goes with `basalt revoke`, which is exactly
 *    the failure the invite path has and is documented with.
 *  - **After the save.** A finished device. The connection below only confirms
 *    it, so failing there costs a retry and no state.
 *
 * There is deliberately no resumable half-state. The root and the device
 * credential never sit on disk together, so a stolen laptop cannot re-derive
 * the vault's credential and register itself again, and there is no shape a
 * config can be in that some later command has to recognise and finish.
 *
 * The first two crash points are walked against a real server in
 * cli/state.test.ts, "a vault that was started and never joined ": the
 * refusal that hands the recovery key back and pairs again with it, notes and
 * all, and the row a failed save leaves for `basalt revoke` to take.

 * one function because four copies of these words is how three of them come to
 * be missing a sentence. `init`'s copy was: it printed the recovery key and
 * said "unlink here, and pair with that key", which is right and incomplete.
 * A registration may already have committed, so pairing again registers a
 * *second* row, and each retry silently spends one of the vault's eight device
 * slots. `pair`'s copy said so; `init`'s did not.
 *
 * What each state is owed:
 *
 *  - **credential**: the row is real and this is the only copy of its key, so
 *    what was written stays and syncing finishes it.
 *  - **root** and **nothing**: no credential here, so a row on the server may
 *    be one nothing can connect as. Naming it is the whole point.
 *  - **unreadable**: nothing is known, so nothing is advised. A `saveConfig`
 *    that succeeded with a read-back that then failed lands here holding a
 *    perfectly good credential, and "revoke the row and pair again" would
 *    throw away a row this device could have used. It takes a disk that writes
 *    and will not read back, which is exactly the disk that makes the advice
 *    wrong, so the refusal says what is unknown instead of guessing.
 *
 * Whether a row exists cannot be read off a config, and saying so is the
 * honest part. `registered` is one way only: true means the server was seen to
 * accept the registration, false means it may still have committed with the
 * reply lost. So a row "was" or "may have been" registered, and never was not.
 *
 * The way back is pair-again-then-revoke rather than revoke-then-pair-again,
 * because the stranded row is often the vault's only one, and revoking the
 * last row takes `--allow-last` and the recovery key. Pairing first makes it
 * an ordinary revocation from an ordinary device.
 *
 * cli/state.test.ts walks these against a real server, and plugin/main.test.ts
 * walks the panel's two paths.
