 * has `appendFile` and Obsidian's `DataAdapter` has `append`. The reasoning
 * and the crash semantics are in `core/index-journal-store.ts`, which is where
 * both shells get them from; everything here is the five file operations it
 * needs and nothing else.
 *
 * The snapshot write is atomic. An index truncated by a crash is worse than no
 * index at all: no index re-reads the vault and recovers, while a half-written
 * one is read as fact and quietly disagrees with the server about what has
 * been synced. The log is different by construction, because a record that did
 * not land whole is discarded on the next load and the records before it are
 * not, and that is a device redoing a pass rather than a device believing
