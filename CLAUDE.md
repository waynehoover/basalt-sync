# Basalt Sync

Self-hosted sync for Obsidian. One binary, one pairing string.

## Layout

- `server/` is the Go server. Its binary is `basaltd`, and every subcommand it
  has is a server operation: serve, backup, verify, purge, stats, service,
  health.
- `client/src/core` is the sync engine, which knows nothing about where files
  live. `client/src/cli` is the headless client, whose binary is `basalt`.
  `client/src/plugin` is the Obsidian plugin.
- Two binaries, two names, because a homelab runs both.

Read `docs/design.md` before adding anything. It is short and it is the
point of the project.

## The first rule

**Do not lose a note.** When simplicity and correctness conflict, correctness
wins and the feature gets cut instead. `docs/design.md` lists eleven durability
rules, each with the incident that produced it; they are not aspirational.

## Scope, and what is refused

One backend, one transport, one platform, one person's devices on a private
network. No S3, no CouchDB, no peer-to-peer, no teams, no web UI, no settings
screen. Refusals are in the philosophy doc and are decisions, not gaps.

## Protocol

`docs/protocol.md`. Basalt does not speak Obsidian Sync's protocol; every rule
in ours inverts a specific defect in theirs, six of which fail silently.

## Conventions

- The server is a single static binary: pure-Go SQLite, no cgo, no external
  database, no message broker. TLS is terminated in front of it by
  `tailscale serve` or a tunnel, so no key material lives here.
- The server never sees plaintext or the passphrase, and must never need to.
- Every vault write on a dev machine goes through the `obsidian` CLI, never
  `mv`/`rm`/`cp`. Obsidian's index and any sync engine learn about changes
  through the file watcher; writes behind its back are invisible to sync and
  not reliably repairable.
- Verify against the shipped artifact, never infer. Where an artifact cannot
  answer, say so rather than guess.

## Testing

**Run `scripts/check.sh` before pushing.** It runs every check CI runs and
nothing less. Exit 0 means all of them passed *here*; exit 2 means some could
not run, which is not the same thing and is not green.

Exit 0 is not the same as CI being green, and it was once written here as
though it were. The drift guard compares CI's step names against the script, so
it catches a step CI grows that the script does not run; it cannot catch a step
that runs in both places and fails in only one. Four consecutive CI failures
were that: a request timer that fires only on a machine slow enough to still be
running a second later, a default device name too long because the runner's
hostname is, and a systemd version wording an error differently. All three
passed locally every time. So: run the script before pushing, and read CI
before believing a release is green.

This exists because of a shipped regression. `bun run test` is one of nine
checks, and the stress suite is a separate command in a separate job. A release
went out on a green `bun run test` while `bun run stress` had been failing the
whole time, on the same machine, catching precisely the bug that shipped. "The
tests pass" was true and meant much less than it sounded. A guard inside the
script fails when CI grows a step the script does not run, so the two cannot
drift apart again.

Unit tests are necessary and never sufficient here. Every real bug found in the
predecessor was a *silent* failure that only appeared when the system ran. A fix
without a test that failed before it is not finished: revert the fix, watch the
test fail, restore it.

## Prior art

`docs/compared.md` credits every project this one learned from. Add to it when
reading someone else's code changes something here. The two that come up most:

- `~/code/obionesync`, the predecessor, which piggybacks Obsidian's own engine.
  Its README and CLAUDE.md hold the verified protocol facts about Obsidian Sync.
- [obsidian-livesync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync), MIT. Source
  of the content-defined chunking idea and the confirmation that text merging is
  solved. Considerably broader in scope; see the philosophy doc on why we are not.
