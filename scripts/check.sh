# Everything CI runs, run here, in one command.
#
# This exists because of a shipped regression. `bun run test` is one of nine
# checks CI runs, and the stress suite is a separate command and a separate
# job. A release went out on a green `bun run test` while `bun run stress` had
# been failing the whole time, on this machine, catching exactly the bug that
# shipped. "The tests pass" was true and meant less than it sounded.
#
# So: one command, and a guard below that fails when CI grows a step this
# script does not know about. The two cannot drift, because drifting is itself
# a failure.
#
# Exit 0 means every check CI runs passed here. Nothing else means that. A
# check that could not run locally is a failure too, not a footnote, because
# the whole lesson is that a partial pass reads exactly like a complete one.
# Pass --skip-docker to accept that one deliberately.
