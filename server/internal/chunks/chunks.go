// Package chunks is a content-addressed store for encrypted chunk bodies.

// It is deliberately free of any dependency on the entry store, the wire

// boundary is the one worth keeping clean, because it is where "do not lose a

// so the bytes here are ciphertext and the name is a hash of ciphertext. That is
// what lets the server dedup without learning anything.

// A chunk name is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the *encrypted* chunk bytes.

//
// The first is verification. If the server cannot recompute the name from the
// body, it cannot tell a correct chunk from a corrupt one, and "stored" becomes
// a claim rather than a fact. Rule 4 of the philosophy doc is about exactly
// this: verify the outcome, not the exit code.
//
// The second is that a fixed-width hex name makes path traversal impossible by
// construction. An arbitrary client-supplied string used as a filename is a
// directory traversal waiting to happen, and defending against it by re-hashing
// the string would throw away verification to buy back the safety the fixed

// and a sweep will collect them. The entry commit then fails, the client
// re-uploads, and the next sweep takes them again: under any sustained purge
// activity, pushes never complete. Two thirds of the pushes in that test
// starved.
//
// An hour is far longer than any single push and short enough that debris from a
// crashed one is collected on the next purge rather than never. The cost of the
// window is disk; the cost of not having it is a vault that cannot be written
// to while it is being tidied.

// being committed. That lock is load-bearing and this package cannot take it,
// which is why this is a documented precondition rather than something Sweep
// works out for itself.
//
// cutoff is the grace boundary: a chunk whose body was written at or after it is
// kept even when nothing references it, because an in-flight push may be about
// to. The caller passes time.Now().Add(-DefaultGrace). A zero cutoff disables
// the protection and is only correct where nothing can be in flight.
//
// Sweep never reports success it has not verified: a body it fails to remove is
// an error, not a silent omission from the count.

// purge into a failure that deleted history and reclaimed nothing.
